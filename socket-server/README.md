# Socket-Server (Server)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.4.

## Motivation
I wanted to make a learn [socket io](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io) while making something for me and my friends. The code isn't optimized, because it was my first try working with socket io and building an Angular website on my own without any help from outside sources (except internet of course). This is also my the first time making UNO, which I really like the outcome of the project thusfar.
